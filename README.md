# CrowdQCplus

Quality control (QC) to filters suspicious data from citizen weather stations (CWS). 

Based on the package 'CrowdQC', but offering several additions and improvements. 
All code is fully backwards compatible so that existing users of 'CrowdQC' can also use the new functions with existing code.
