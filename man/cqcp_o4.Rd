\usage{
cqcp_o4(data, time_constant, quiet = FALSE)
}
\arguments{
\item{data}{data.table in CrowdQC+ format (columns "time" and "ta" must be present)}

\item{time_constant}{Time constant value for the sensor in seconds (must be 
the same for all p_id). Time constant/tau is defined as the time for a 
system's step response to â‰ˆ 63.2 % of its final (asymptotic) value (from a 
step change) (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time_constant).}

\item{quiet}{Suppress messages by CrowdQC+. Default: FALSE}
}
\value{

}
\description{
Optional QC for data correction. Corrects all values for a known time constant 
(tau) of the sensor. This value must be the same for all stations/p_id and it is 
assumed that tau is constant, regardless of weather conditions. In the 
correction it is assumed that a step change in the values happens at each time 
step to the next.
In the correction the original data "ta" is used instead of the interpolated
values "ta_int". Hence, this function can be applied at/after any QC level. 
Diverging from all other QC levels, no additional flag variable with TRUE/FALSE 
is added to the data.table for cqcp_o4. Data after the correction thus can be 
selected at any QC level.
